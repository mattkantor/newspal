  title: Republicans are optimistic about their chances of holding (and maybe even
    expanding) their one-seat majority. But, is that right?
  body: "On Sunday, The New York Times published a piece headlined \"Senate Republicans
    Are Newly Hopeful About the Midterms. For Good Reason.\" The argument in the piece,
    as the headline suggests, is that Republicans are -- and should be -- optimistic
    about their chances of holding (and maybe even expanding) their one-seat majority.\n

  body: "The 2018 midterm season is upon us and the storyline in the House and Senate
    will be the balance of power and whether Republians can hold their majorities
    in both chambers. The momentum is tipping toward Democrats big time, particularly
    in House races, according to the latest CNN reporting. But Democrats are defending
    more than two dozen Senate seats, including 10 in states President Donald Trump
    won in 2016. Republicans have just eight Senate seats up for re-election.\n    \n"

  title: 'Mika Brzezinski on Bill Clinton’s Lewinsky Interview: ‘My God, He Sounded
    Like Trump’'
  body: 'Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” co-host Mika Brzezinski reacted to former
    President Bill Clinton‘s heated interview on NBC’s “Today” about his affair with Monica
    Lewinsky. Brzezinski said, “It has been for decades an unbelievable double standard
    that the Clintons have used and abused, where nobody is allowed to go there on
    this issue. And in the age of #MeToo, women are supposed to go there, and men,
    by the way. We’re supposed to be able to say what the difference is between right
    and wrong, and when you have done something wrong, you are supposed to own it
    and not talk about facts, distorted facts, and obstructed facts.” She added, “My
    God, he sounded like Trump. He sounded incapable of owning anything. To me, I’ve
    never been more moved by an interview, and I really appreciate that Craig Melvin
    asked those questions and put that entire interview to a stop and stayed with
    it, finally. Finally.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'

  body: Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” former House Speaker
    Newt Gingrich predicted a “red wave” in the 2018 midterm elections. Gingrich said,
    “For everybody in America who thinks that the cost of living is too low the Democrats
    are a great party for them, because they will raise taxes as they have in California with
    this huge gas tax increase. I actually believe we are closer to a red wave than
    a blue wave.” He added, “Now if you went back to December, frankly I was concerned.
    The huge generic gap we had not yet passed the tax cuts. Things didn’t feel right.
    People were upset that they had a year and things hadn’t been accomplished but
    starting with passing the tax cuts, with what President Trump has done consistently
    on conservative judges, on deregulation, on trade negotiations, what he’s done
    with North Korea. I think people now have a sense that we’re moving in the right direction
    and as a result for example, in the Senate, I think — I can’t imagine I don’t
    know of anybody who’s a serious student who believes the Democrats have any hope
    of winning the Senate.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

    McAuliffe (D-VA) said former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State
    Hillary Clinton did “a horrible thing” in the way they attacked former White House
    intern Monica Lewinsky, who had an affair with Bill Clinton. Partial transcript
    as follows:  HUNT: Given what we know now and the way this movement has unfolded,
    should Bill Clinton have resigned over the Monica Lewinsky scandal? MCAULIFFE:
    This was 25 years ago, it was difficult—different standards. I think people looked
    at it in totality. HUNT: Why were they different standards? MCAULIFFE: I’m saying
    at the time we dealt with this 25 years ago, it wasn’t the standards we have today.
    I think if it happened today, I don’t think you’d be having the same argument
    that would go on with the new #MeToo movement. But 25 years ago, as I say, it
    was a different standard. HUNT: Do you think the Clintons victimized Monica Lewinsky
    in that, do you think the way they dealt with her would be tolerable today? MCAULIFFE:
    No, I don’t. I think it was a horrible thing 25 years ago. As you know, we’re

  title: Bill Clinton Spars with NBC's Craig Melvin --- 'You Are Giving One Side and
    Omitting Facts'
  body: Monday on NBC’s “Today,” former President Bill Clinton seemingly dismissed
    a question as to whether or not he owed former White House intern Monica Lewinsky in
    the era of the “#MeToo movement.” Clinton was combative in his response to the
    question posed to him by NBC News’ Craig Melvin. “I apologized to everybody in
    the world,” Clinton replied to the question about Lewinsky. “I have not talked
    to her,” he added when asked specifically about Lewinsky. “I never talked to her.
    But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry. That’s very
    different. The apology was public.” Later Clinton acknowledged he did not go unscathed
    from the Lewinsky scandal. “Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,”
    he said. “I left the White House $16 million in debt.” He then criticized Melvin
    for the premise of his Lewinsky questioning. “You are giving one side and omitting
    facts,” Clinton added. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

  body: 'Wealthy, mostly white soccer clubs in the US have long snatched up the best
    pitches – but in liberal Seattle, one official is taking a standA few years ago,
    Exequiel Soltero wanted to rent two soccer fields in a well-to-do Seattle suburb.
    Finding places for his Latino immigrant soccer league to play matches had become
    quite a challenge: the area’s soccer fields were always snatched up by wealthy,
    mostly white clubs who had the money and expertise to navigate the city’s leasing
    process. It was a complaint he often heard from other clubs in Seattle’s lower

    the conflux of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the south-western Chinese megacity
    of Chongqing. Eight skyscrapers are rising from the river banks: two above 350m
    and six above 250m. Raffles City Chongqing, a project headed by the architect
    Moshe Safdie, will boast 134,000 sq m of homes, shops, offices, entertainment,
    transportation links and a public park. It also features a more unusual claim
    to fame: a “horizontal skyscraper” 300m in length, stretching across four of the
    main towers at the 42nd floor. With the building situated in an earthquake zone,
    it “floats” on top of the towers to create the necessary sway. Continue reading...'

    over the conduct of the agency’s executive director, Michel Sidibé.  Continue

  body: Analysis of lifetime earnings across 141 countries suggests failure to reward
    women and men equally generates huge global lossGender equality would enrich the
    global economy by an estimated $160tn (£120tn) if women were earning as much as
    men in the workplace, a study by the World Bank has found.Equal pay, equal hours
    and equal participation in the workforce could lead to a global wealth jump of
    $23,620 a person, as well as creating knock-on benefits such as lower malnutrition

  title: Does Trump really think preaching celibacy can beat HIV? | Serra Sippel
  body: As US aid cuts take a ruinous toll on women’s health, it is vital short-sighted
    ideology does not outweigh hard factsIt is no secret that the US president’s emergency
    plan for Aids relief, launched by George Bush in 2003, is one of the most successful
    public health campaigns in history. Known as Pepfar, it now reaches more than
    14 million people with lifesaving HIV treatment. In the past 15 years, it has
    enabled more than 2.2 million children to be born free from HIV and has reached
    more than 15.2 million boys and men with voluntary medical circumcisions, a procedure
    that can prevent new HIV infections.However, Pepfar’s most striking accomplishment
    is the sharp drop in new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women
    in sub-Saharan Africa. In just three years, these infections have declined by
    between 25% and 40% in nearly two-thirds of districts with the highest HIV prevalence.

  body: Populist triumph is consequence of disdain shown by elite towards the people

    that nobody noticed, a house that could suddenly collapse. That suddenly, but
    inevitably, collapses.To understand what has happened, we must first take on board
    that establishment politics has taken its own stability, as well as its ability
    to contain discontent, for granted. As the Italian house collapsed, these politicians
    have continued to demonstrate arrogance and contempt in the face of people’s fears
    and the progressive impoverishment of the nation, and especially of the south.
    The government “experts” have given up seeking genuine communication with people
    – to such an extent that we currently find ourselves wondering what happened to
    the now threadbare relationship of trust between the elite and the people, politicians
    and voters. Continue reading...

    a Heart'' ''He Had a Soul'''
  body: On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Representative Luis Gutierrez
    (D-IL) stated that he did challenge President Obama on family detentions and “Obama
    had a heart. He had a soul. He had a heart. He had a center. He had convictions.
    And we could speak to those.” Gutierrez said, “We challenged Obama. He agreed
    to the consent decree, the Flores consent decree. And I want to say one last thing…you
    know, Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said I only can keep children
    in detention for 20 days. I will resign as secretary of homeland security if I
    can’t release the moms along with them. And here’s what the Obama administration
    began to do, 20 days detention for children, as they apply for their asylum request,
    right, and the children and the moms were released together. That’s the way you
    do things, transparent, open. We did challenge Obama, but you know what, Obama
    had a heart. He had a soul. He had a heart. He had a center. He had convictions.
    And we could speak to those.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

    its “Mass Games” event for the first time in five years. The North Korean government
    has never explained why the games were halted in 2013 after a big show to commemorate
    the Korean War armistice, or why they are being relaunched now, but the obvious
    inference is that Pyongyang wishes to appear more open to the West and welcoming
    to tourists as diplomacy with the United States unfolds.

  title: 'Swalwell: Ending Separations Is Good, But Trump EO ''Could Lead to Family
    Internment Camps'''
  body: On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Representative Eric Swalwell
    (D-CA) stated that ending the separation of families is the right thing to do,
    but President Trump’s executive order “could lead to family internment camps,”
    and there need to be more resources devoted to ensure asylum cases are adjudicated
    quickly. Anchor Wolf Blitzer asked, “Congressman, this executive order that the
    president just signed, apparently will keep families together, but they will be
    together in detention while parents face criminal prosecution. Is that the solution
    you were hoping for?” Swalwell answered, “No, Wolf. … You know, this policy of
    breaking the bond between parents and children and putting children in cages is
    inhumane, and the president was right to stop that policy, but let’s not give
    him a medal for starting the fire and then bringing the fire hose. The best thing
    we can do is to stay loud as American citizens, because I think that’s what moved
    him to do the right thing. But also to make sure that we are not indefinitely
    detaining families, and that we devote resources so we can adjudicate these asylum
    cases as quickly as possible, and also that the ports of entry are open.

    Doing?'
  body: Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” former Mayor of New
    York City and President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani said the bias from
    Peter Strzok, the FBI agent responsible for anti-Trump text messages has permanently
    tainted special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. Giuliani said, “If in fact
    this is infected with a bias of major proportions from the beginning by Strzok
    —and it seems like it is — and he left behind some of his cohorts, we believe
    there may be two of the people with similar bias expressed in texts that are presently
    working on the investigation. In that is the case how can you trust anything they’re
    doing if that’s the case in this investigation?” He added, “When you have guys
    around you who are saying ‘stop the president, America must be saved, we have
    to stop him at all costs’ you can’t possibly trust that. I can’t see a court allowing
    them any indictments to go forward, any report there to be issued unless this
    gets solved. I said a couple of days ago, even before all this came out, we have
    to investigate the investigators in order to determine whether it’s a valid investigation.”

  body: Bloc hikes funds for Africa by 20% but reports highlight rights breaches and

  body: Argentina’s president once talked of forcing slums out of the city – now he
    wants to deliver residents the deeds to their land. But will it help?“It was really
    bad in there – I mean, it’s literally a ruin,” says Romina Vargas of Argentina’s
    most famous abandoned building, where she once lived. “There was lots of contaminated
    water on the lower floors, there were no sewers, and kids would come and take
    drugs inside. It’s good that it’s coming down.”Built in the 1930s and later championed
    by president Juan Domingo Perón, the 14-storey building in south-west Buenos Aires
    was intended to be the largest hospital in Latin America; a cornerstone of Perón’s
    grand populist vision for Argentina. But construction stopped abruptly in 1955
    with a military coup. The abandoned colossus at the edge of the capital became
    known as the White Elephant. Continue reading...

    tiles as part of his one-man mission to salvage a century of Catalan heritage
    Joel Cánovas was sipping a beer on a patio in Barcelona when a piece of rubbish
    caught his eye. A section of hydraulic cement tile – the once-ubiquitous flooring
    material used in homes around the city for a century or so from the mid-1800s
    – had been discarded during a home renovation. Cánovas picked up the tile, and
    a passion was born. Spotting tiles in dumpsters throughout Barcelona, Cánovas
    soon began to document his discoveries on Instagram as The Tile Hunter (@i_rescue_tiles).

  body: Attempt to calm outcry over his ‘zero-tolerance’ border policy raises further

    women were at their farm when they were taken by 80 soldiers belonging to Myanmar
    military, and were repeatedly gang-raped by the troops before eventually being
    released four days later. This tragically now familiar sounding story of a crime
    in Myanmar did not occur during the “clearance operations” following August 2017
    in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State, but in July 2000 on the other side of the
    country in Shan State. This case was documented in a 2002 report Licence to Rape,
    along with 172 other cases of sexual violence perpetrated in Shan State between
    1991 and 2001. Far too many such crimes have been committed with scant consequences
    faced by the culprits. On ensuring accountability for gross violations of human
    rights in Myanmar, so far the international community has failed.  Continue reading...

    she’s officially the Marie Antoinette of this administration. It should just say
    ‘let them eat cake,’ that they literally just don’t care about what’s happening
    there. Again, I was in Washington this morning. Nobody’s wearing jackets, first
    of all. Second of all, this is a woman who spends a lot of time very carefully
    picking out what she’s going to wear. This was not an accident. This was intentional.”
    President Donald Trump later tweeted, claiming it was about the “fake news media.”
    “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” written on the back of Melania’s jacket, refers to

    Doesn’t Necessarily Pass'''
  body: Thursday at his weekly press conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) conceded
    the two bills on immigration scheduled for a House vote today, the Goodlatte immigration
    bill and the GOP compromise bill, are likely to not pass. Ryan said, “DACA is
    broken, the immigration system is broken, the border is not fully secured. These
    are facts. They need to be solved, and at the end of the day, I really believe
    we will come back around. If a bill doesn’t pass today, we’re going to come back
    to the president’s four pillars.” He continued, “The promise and the goal was
    always—we were never going to be able to promise an outcome but we can promise
    an effort and a fair process, and that is what is going to be delivered today.”
    He added,  “I actually think we’re advancing the cause even if something doesn’t
    necessarily pass. I think we are making advancements because we are putting ideas
    on the table, members are able to express themselves, and we brought to the floor
    the kind of process that our members have been asking for even if it might not
    result in law.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

    for securing our borders. We know that that is a responsibility that we have.
    But we don’t think that we have to put children in cages to do it. There is a
    better way.” She added, “The president is either not knowing, not caring, delusional,
    in denial about his own policies being outside the circle of civilized human behavior.”

  body: On Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “MTP Daily,” Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR)
    stated that President Trump’s immigration plan is a “handcuffs for all” plan and
    “we did this before. It was called a Japanese internment camp.” Merkley said the
    president’s plan didn’t do anything to help children who have already been separated
    from their families, and is “handcuffs for all. We’re not just going to throw
    the parents in prison. We’re going to throw the children in prison. Now, we did
    this before. It was called a Japanese internment camp. And it was a dark period
    in America to put families in prison. That is not the answer. What the answer
    is are programs that work, like the program — like the case manager program, which
    had 100% success rate in getting people to their hearings.” Follow Ian Hanchett

  body: PARIS (AP) — Europol says armed jihadis plotted or carried out more attacks
    in Europe last year than in 2016, with a total of 33 attacks either planned or
    executed. A report the law enforcement agency issued Wednesday said 10 plots were
    realized in 2017, most of them committed by homegrown European extremists who
    had never traveled abroad. Why is it so many radical Jihadists are known to the
    police for dealing drugs? https://t.co/hyMU5lwWOF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon)
    June 1, 2017 Knives were the primary weapons used in attacks and the majority
    was blamed on the Islamic State group even as it lost territory in Iraq and Syria.
    IS is releasing far less new propaganda after years of relying upon it to draw
    thousands of Europeans to join its cause. The Europol report said the group’s
    prior online recruitment materials are being recycled or redistributed in other
    formats.

    not working in good faith with his party to resolve the border issue. According
    to McCaul, Democrats were not interested in a resolution, but having it as a campaign
    issue. “I think they are completely interested in making this a campaign issue,”
    McCaul said. “And even though the president resolved the family separation issue
    on a temporary basis, they condemn him for that. I don’t think they have any interest
    in working constructively with us, but rather use this in the 2018 midterm elections.”

  title: 'Malcolm Jenkins: NFL Introduced New Anthem Policy ''Out of Fear'' -- ''It
    Really Backfired'''
  body: Thursday on ESPN’s “Get Up,” Philadelphia Eagles safety and activist Malcolm
    Jenkins discussed the NFL’s new National Anthem policy that requires players to
    either stand on the field or remain in the locker room. According to Jenkins,
    the new policy was like a slap in the face. “It kinda undermines everything you
    thought you were working for,” Jenkins told co-host Michelle Beadle. “It thwarts
    that right to speak your mind and really fight for your communities … especially
    because we felt like they understood where we were coming from. We grabbed the
    league’s hand and showed them exactly the issues that we’ve been fighting for
    — that it was about creating a fair justice system, that is about ending mass
    incarceration, re-reconciling our relationships with law enforcement. They have
    seen the work we have done for two years first-hand. And so, I think out of fear
    and to balance, you know, I guess both sides and play the middle, they put in
    this policy. And I think, like I said, it really backfired.” Follow Trent Baker

    from Their Parents'''
  body: TMZ Sports asked UFC President Dana White this week about children and parents
    being separated when trying to illegally cross the United States-Mexico border.
    White said the policy was set before President Donald Trump came into office,
    adding it was a “sad” situation because children should never be taken from their
    parents. “I don’t think anybody likes it. I don’t even think Trump likes it, to
    be honest with you. I think it’s something that was set in place and I think it’s
    just coming to light right now and [it’s] very sad. There should never be a scenario
    where you take kids away from their parents for any reason whatsoever, ever, ever.”
    White told the reporter. He added, “They’d have to shoot me to take my kids.”

  body: The far-right Italian interior minister has stoked immigration concerns to
    grab the spotlightIn the early years, when he was still a secessionist who believed
    northern Italy should break off and become an independent state called Padania,
    Matteo Salvini held his fellow countrymen in such contempt that he even supported
    Germany over Italy in the 2006 World Cup. “Italy ... is the worst of the worst,”
    he said at the time. “My support goes to anyone who is more serious.”  Continue

  body: 'Treaty that sliced up territory after first world war remains a source of
    anti-liberal sentimentThe signing of a 1920 peace treaty does not immediately
    sound like ideal subject matter for musical theatre. But on Friday and Saturday
    night, hundreds of singers, dancers, acrobats and horsemen will fill the vast
    concrete expanse of Budapest’s Heroes’ Square for performances of Trianon: the
    rock opera.The treaty of Trianon sliced up Hungary in the aftermath of the first
    world war and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It still features heavily
    in Hungarians’ historical imagination 98 years later, and the so-called “Trianon
    trauma” is one of the building blocks for the nationalism of Viktor Orbán’s government.

  title: The US demolished Raqqa when they 'liberated' it. Who will rebuild it? |
    Molly Crabapple
  body: A recent Amnesty International report makes clear the cost of America’s ‘war
    of annihilation’ against IsisEarlier this month, Amnesty International released
    a report proving that the US-led coalition had committed war crimes in their final
    push to oust Isis from their capitol in Raqqa. Amnesty’s report is harrowing.
    39 members of a single family killed. A father listening to the pleas of his children,
    buried under rubble, as they slowly died of thirst. A city destroyed. Hundreds,
    perhaps thousands of civilians dead, not the 21 the US military so risibly claimed.  Unsurprisingly,
    it barely made a blip in the US media. Once, Isis stalked American nightmares.
    “Bomb Isis,” Americans demanded. Now, America’s moved on, with little care for
    the ruins those bombings left. Continue reading...

    other estimates have put the number significantly higher). Most centres are found
    in cramped rooms or homes, with one woman responsible for 20 or so children. Ventilation
    is poor and there are reports of babies being given sleeping pills to knock them

  body: Populists are exploiting citizens’ fears while ignoring root causes of migration
    crisesLike a timebomb waiting to go off, Europe’s smouldering immigration problem
    exploded into a full-blown crisis last week. The US experienced a similar delayed
    upheaval, after the human consequences of Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” border
    policy became too painful to ignore. The two events are closely linked, the product
    of systemic international failings.The longstanding inability of governments to
    cope with challenges posed by the increased flows of refugees, asylum seekers
    and economic migrants is common to both sides of the Atlantic. The ensuing vacuum
    has been filled by opportunists such as Trump, maverick fringe parties, andrightwing
    zealots such as Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and the US attorney
    general, Jeff Sessions.  Continue reading...
